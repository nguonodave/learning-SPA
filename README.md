# üß™ Vanilla JS SPA With Golang Server ‚Äì Post platform for text and images

This is a personal learning project where I'm exploring the core concepts behind Single Page Applications (SPAs) without using any frameworks or libraries. Just **pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.**

üñºÔ∏è Users can:
- Create and log into their accounts
- Create posts with images
- View all existing posts
- Navigate smoothly without full page reloads
- Filter posts based on categories

The goal isn‚Äôt just to build a working app, but to **understand how SPAs work under the hood** - including routing, state management, DOM updates, and client-server communication. The backend is powered by **Golang** for handling API requests and user data.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Expect messy code and experimental features. It's a lab, not a product.
